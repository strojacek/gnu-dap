			INSTALLING DAP



GENERALITIES

This document concerns building and installing Dap from sources.

Dap will configure and build under a number of common Unix-like platforms.
The directions here are for GNU/Linux; the configure and build
for other platforms are similar.

Dap is a GNU program and is free software distributed under a
GNU-style copyleft. See the file COPYING for details.

GETTING AND UNPACKING THE SOURCES

The simplest way is to download the most recent `dap-x.y.tar.gz' package,

	gunzip -c dap-x.y.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

COMPILATION

Choose a place to install dap and its documentation.  Let's call this
place `DAP_HOME'.  Untar the source code.  This should create directories
`src', `doc', and `examples'.  

If you want the executables, includes, library, and info files installed
in subdirectories `bin', `include', `lib', and `info', respectively, of
`/usr/local', then simply issue the following commands:

	./configure
	make
        make install

Otherwise, edit `Makefile.in' to select a different place to install
and then type the above commands. Note: when DAP_HOME/src/dap.c
compiles, you will get a warning:

	implicit declaration of function `strcat'

and when DAP_HOME/src/dap0.c compiles, you will get a warning:

	implicit declaration of function `dap_main'

Ignore these warnings.  Now rehash.  

With new updates (version 3.8)  the above warnings may not occur.



ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are used by Dap:

DAPEDITOR     path name for Emacs
DAPEDOPTS     options for the Emacs front-end
DAPPAGER      for viewing tabular output from Dap
DAPPAGEOPTS   options for that pager
DAPCOMPILER   for compiling programs to run under Dap
DAPCOMPOPTS   options for that compiler
DAPVIEWER     for viewing graphical output from Dap
DAPVIEWOPTS   options for that viewer
DAPPP         path name for the Dap preprocessor
              (default: /usr/local/bin/dappp)
DAPRUNS       path name for the Dap process that runs the
              preprocessor and complier
              (default: /usr/local/bin/dapruns)
INCDIR        directory for compiler to find <dap.h>
              (default: /usr/local/include)
LIBDIR        directory for compiler to find libdap.a
              (default: /usr/local/lib)

All but the last four are further documented in the manual.

READING THE MANUAL

To read the manual in info, you will need to have `/usr/local/info' (or
whatever directory you installed the info file in) in your `INFOPATH'.
The following command (which you will probably want to put in your
shell's `rc' file) will do that:

	setenv INFOPATH ".:/usr/info:/usr/local/info"

Then issue the command:

	info dap

If you prefer dvi or html manuals, they can be made from the
file:

	DAP_HOME/doc/dap.texi

(See the documentation for texi2dvi, dvips, and texinfo.)

The manual will tell you how to run and use dap.  The program
and data files for the examples in the manual are in the
directory DAP_HOME/doc/examples.

MACHINE DEPENDENCY

Dap assumes that you have a machine with 64-bit double precision
floating point numbers conforming to the IEEE floating point
standard.  If that is not the case, then you may have to modify
`machdep.c'; good luck.

BUG REPORTS AND COMMENTS

Send bug reports to <bug-dap@gnu.org>.

If you use dap, please let me know about your
experience using it, and suggestions, also by mailing
to <bug-dap@gnu.org>. (Don't worry that it's not a bug report!)
Thanks.
