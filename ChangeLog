           1 for tables that fit the independence model exactly.
           Dap now recognizes ".sbs" files that conform to SAS
           syntax and translates them into Dap ".c" files and
           processes them. At this time, only simple SAS
           constructions are recognized. This involves modifications
           to files: dap.c, daprun.c, dapruns.c, dappp.c. In addition,
           new files sbstrans.c, sbstrans1.c, and sbs.h were created.

           made functions "categ" and "loglin" in file dap6.c
           call function "dataset" to fill the table before
           processing.
2003/05/04 Function "categ" prints out the parameter estimates
           even if the covariance matrix is singular. Removed
           extraneous output from function "categ1".

           "dap_swap" in functions "histo1" and
           "normal1".
2001/11/15 Version 1.5: in dap2.c, in functions
           "groupparse" and "group", changed
           "NUMBER", "FRACTION", "PERCENT" to
           "#", "/", "%", respectively and
           allow variables to follow, after
           starting and direction specification,
           if any, and don't count observation if
           any of those variables has a nonfinite
           value.
2001/11/14 Version 1.4: in dap2.c: in function
           "pctile1", added printing of RANGE.
2001/11/14 Version 1.4: in dap1.c: in function
           "dap_mnsparse", return negative of number
           of variables if the only stat requested
           is N and the variable is undefined; in
           function "means", use return value of
           "dap_mnsparse" to determine whether to
           count missing values.
2001/11/13 Version 1.4: in dap0.c, in function
           "dap_vd": changed respecification
           checking to clarify error message and
           set double value to NaN, int value to 0,
           and string value to "" and in functions
           "dap_dl" and "dap_il", set the values of
           the variables in the user's program to NaN,
           0, and "", resp.
2001/11/01 Version 1.4: in dap0.c in function
           "step", return 0 if zero-length line
           read.
2001/10/31 Version 1.4: in dap1.c, in functions
           "means" and "meansout", incorporated
           testing for and only including in
           computations NaN values in data.
           This included making variables "nobs"
           and "dn" into arrays, allocating them
           and freeing them. Incorporated testing only
           for NaNs in dap2.c in functions "pctiles",
           "corr", "group", and "trim" and in dap3.c
           in functions "plot" and "normal".
           In dap2.c, made function "valcpy"
           static, as it should have been.
2001/10/18 Version 1.4: fixed bug in function
           "plotmeans" in dap3.c: in checking for
           partvars being non-null, also check
           first character if non-NULL.
2001/10/17 Version 1.4: in dap2.c, streamlined code
           for functions "group" and "trim" and the
           functions that they call.
2001/10/15 Version 1.4: in dap3.c, in function
           "histogram", if there are missing values
           this is now reported to the .err file instead
           of the .log file. Added "style" options "MIN"
           and "MAX" to function "histogram". Deleted
           "style" option ZERO (which was never
           documented in the manual).
2001/10/10 Version 1.3: in dap4.c, functions "effects"
           and "ftest" now check types of variables
2001/10/09 Version 1.3: fixed bug in dap3.c: in function
           "plotlinreg", length of variable "srtarg" was
           1 too short.
2001/10/01 Version 1.3: Added statistics to function
           "means": VARM (variance of the mean with
           df = number of observations - 1)), VARMFREQ
           (variance of the mean with df = sum of
           weights - 1).  Updated dap_make.h
           accordingly.
2001/09/28 Version 1.3: Removed clumsy function
           "dap_param"; now header file dap.h does
           #ifdef to determine whether user defined
           parameters ABOVE #include <dap.h>,
           otherwise sets defaults.
2001/09/27 Version 1.3: Write errors to .err file,
           report lines read, written to .log file;
           only display .err automatically.
2001/09/26 Version 1.3: Fixed bug in function
           "dap_rest": incorrect reference to do_in
           list.
2001/09/26 Version 1.3: Function "step" now reports the
           file name in which an error was encountered.
           On end of file, "step" also reports, in the
           log file, the number of lines read.
           Appropriate log lines are now labeled with
           "ERROR" or "WARNING".
2001/09/24 Version 1.3: Fixed bug in function "dataset":
           clearing values of variables in oldname that
           are not in newname.
2001/09/24 Version 1.3: in dap2.c, incorporated weighted
           percentiles into function "pctile" by (1) adding
           a weight variable and values, (2) calling
           "dap_mnsparse" (renamed from "meansparse" and
           no longer static in dap1.c and entered into
           dap_make.h), and (3) calling the new function
           "pctile2" if weighting is present.
2001/09/15 Version 1.3: Renamed "probn" and "npoint" to
           "probz" and "zpoint", resp.
2001/09/15 Version 1.2: In src/dap3.c, function "plot1",
           changed title0 to static, allocated once, don't
           free.
2001/09/15 Version 1.2: Renamed functions "invprobchisq",
           "invprobf", "invprobn", and "invprobt" to
           "chisqpoint", "fpoint", "npoint", and "tpoint",
           resp.: src/dap[345].c, src/prob.c, src/dap_make.h,
           src/dap.h, doc/dap.texi
2001/09/14 Corrected a bug: function "invprobn" was
           returning the negative of what it was
           supposed to: src/prob.c Fixed calls to
           "invprobn" in src/dap3.c and src/dap5.c
           accordingly.
2001/09/14 Changed src/dap3.c: added parameters "marks"
           and "nmarks" and added variables "plotmarks"
           and "pn" to functions "plotlinreg" and
           "plotlogreg" so that they could process files
           that are partitioned. Updated doc/dap.texi and
           examples "ms95.c" and "cda88.c", and their
           output accordingly.
2001/09/06 Changed unsigned's to unsigned int's in
           src/machdep.c
2001/09/06 Setting dblhigh, dbllow moved to main() from
           inset(), outset() in src/dap0.c
