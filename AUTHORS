Authors of Dap.

Dap was written by Susan Bassein to use in 
her consulting practice.  The manual was
translated from manualese into English (as
much as possible) with the assistance of
Anna Reidenbach.  If anyone else has good
ideas on how to improve the package, please
don't hesitate to contribute and I will add
your name below.
