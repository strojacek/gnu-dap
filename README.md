The Basic DAP README
---

Gnu Dap is an open source implementation of SAS (Statistical Analysis System).

This repository contains the following changes I have made to the system:

- do to loops (completed)
- Termux compatability (completed)
- cards/datalines (in progress)
- proc sql (in progress)
- sas macros (in progress)
- proc mcmc (in progress)

Note: This is very much a work in progress, and the original codebase was written in C. In order to start the implementation of some newer features, I needed to use generics, and have had to update the C code to C++. 

As a result, the original manual is out of date, in that it references a bunch of C related functions.
