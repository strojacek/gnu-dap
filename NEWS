2003/05/04 Version 2.2: Implemented function "catcon"
           which allows testing of contrasts for

2003/04/30 Version 2.2: Function "categ" now writes
           a dataset with the estimates, ASEs, and

2001/12/30 Version 1.6: In function "outset": if variable

2001/11/19 Version 1.5: In function "group", changed
           "WIDTH" and "COUNT" to '^' and '#", respectively,
           and made them attached to the number of groups;
           in function "group", checked for NaN values of
           grouping variables and don't cound observation
           if there are any.
2001/11/15 Version 1.5: In function "group", changed
           "NUMBER", "FRACTION", "PERCENT" to

           variables to follow, after starting and
           direction specification, if any, and don't

           Incorporated testing only for NaNs in
           functions "pctiles", "corr", "group", "trim",
           "plot", and "normal".
2001/10/15 Version 1.4: In function "histogram", if there
           are missing values this is now reported to
           the .err file instead of the .log file.
           Added "style" options "MIN" and "MAX" to
           function "histogram". Deleted
           "style" option ZERO (which was never
           documented in the manual).
2001/10/01 Version 1.3: Added statistics to function
           "means": VARM (variance of the mean with
           df = number of observations - 1)), VARMFREQ
           (variance of the mean with df = sum of
           weights - 1).
2001/09/28 Version 1.3: Removed clumsy function
           "dap_param"; now header file dap.h does
           #ifdef to determine whether user defined
           parameters ABOVE #include <dap.h>,
           otherwise sets defaults.
2001/09/27 Version 1.3: Write errors to .err file,
           report lines read, written to .log file;
           only display .err automatically.
2001/09/24 Version 1.3: Incorporated weighted
           percentiles into function "pctile" by adding
           a weight variable and values.
2001/09/15 Version 1.3: Renamed "probn" and "npoint" to
           "probz" and "zpoint", resp.
2001/09/15 Version 1.2: Renamed functions "invprobchisq",
           "invprobf", "invprobn", and "invprobt" to
           "chisqpoint", "fpoint", "npoint", and "tpoint".
2001/09/14 Added parameters "marks" and "nmarks" to
           functions "plotlinreg" and "plotlogreg" so that
           they could process files that are partitioned.

           "NUMBER", "FRACTION", "PERCENT" to
           "#", "/", "%", respectively and
           allow variables to follow, after
           starting and direction specification,
           if any, and don't count observation if
           any of those variables has a nonfinite
           value.
2001/10/15 Version 1.4: minimum and maximum points of
           histograms can now be specified.
2001/09/22 Version 1.3: incorporated weighted
           percentiles into function "pctile"; renamed
           functions "probn" and "npoint" to "probz" and
           "zpoint", respectively.
2001/09/15 Renamed functions "invprobchisq", "invprobf",
           "invprobn", and "invprobt" to "chisqpoint",
           "fpoint", "npoint", and "tpoint", resp.
2001/09/14 In version 1.2, the capabilites and syntax
           of functions "plotlinreg" and "plotlogreg"
           have been modified to allow processing of
           datasets that are partitioned.
